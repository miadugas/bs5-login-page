# bs5-login-page

## Taking a first look at Bootstrap 5
- simple login page with Bootstrap 5.0.0 Alpha to highlight some of the changes
- The new Bootstrap Icons also is installed and we'll dig into a few of the new Sass options
- - recommended that Live Sass Compiler is installed if using VS Code

- - Open VS Code settings (the gear icon), search Live Sass Compiler and edit the .json, added to Live Sass Compiler settings:

"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
        {
            "format": "compressed",
            "extensionName": ".css",
            "savePath": "/css"
        }
],
"liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false,
